I'm a second year at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I came into UCLA as an Business Economics major, but quickly found my passion for computer science. After joining a startup called <a href="https://Heylo.co" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>Heylo.co</u></a> as a Campus Lead, I rekindled my passion for startups/tech.

I then joined <a href="https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>ACM Studio</u></a> to work on the development of games (as well as level design.)  

Along the way, I joined <a href="http://iliomirror.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>Ilio Mirror</u></a> as CTO and built a fleshed out minimum viable product with an amazing team.

Currently working on a new product, will release more information soon.
