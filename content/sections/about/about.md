🎓 Senior at the University of California, Los Angeles.

💼 Started as a Business Economics major at UCLA, but swiftly discovered my true passion for computer science. My journey into tech began when I became a Campus Lead at [Heylo.co](https://Heylo.co).

🎮 Later, I ventured into the exciting realm of game development and level design by joining [ACM Studio](https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/).

🚀 Along the way, I took on the role of CTO at [Ilio Mirror](http://iliomirror.com/), where I spearheaded the development of a robust minimum viable product with an exceptional team. I also delved into automating support call systems using [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/).

🌐 Currently, I'm passionately working on a new [project](https://www.validiti.net/); stay tuned for more updates!

👨‍💼 Just concluded my stint at Microsoft, where I served as a product manager intern in Azure Geoexpansion Tooling. Exciting news: I'll be joining Microsoft full-time as a Product Manager for Azure Core!
