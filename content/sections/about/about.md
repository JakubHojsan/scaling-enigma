I'm a senior at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I came into UCLA as an Business Economics major, but quickly found my passion for computer science. After joining a startup called <a href="https://Heylo.co" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>Heylo.co</u></a> as a Campus Lead, I rekindled my passion for startups/tech.

I then joined <a href="https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>ACM Studio</u></a> to work on the development of games (as well as level design.)  

Along the way, I joined <a href="http://iliomirror.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>Ilio Mirror</u></a> as CTO and built a fleshed out minimum viable product with an amazing team. In between, I was working on automation of support call systems using <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>Twilio Flex</u></a>.

Currently working on a new <a href="https://www.validiti.net/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link"><u>product</u></a>, will release more information soon.

Just concluded my work at Microsoft within Azure Geoexpansion as a product manager intern!

Always open to opportunities or to chat.
